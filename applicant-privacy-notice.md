As your (future) employer, we process information about you as necessary in order to meet our obligations related to your employment contract or any other agreement with us (or based on your request to take the necessary steps to enter into such an agreement). We also process information about you as necessary for administrative purposes and to maintain our relationship with you, e.g. for the purpose of recruitment and secondment, reimbursement, payment, tax issues, career and talent development, insider trading laws, performance appraisals, training, travel expenses and other expenses, employee communication, workforce analysis, international assignments, conflict resolution and legal procedures.
